            <p>Hello! My name is Jasper Shen, an undergraduate student at CU Boulder. This website is a reflection of my journey throughout my time in WRTG 3030, where I have grown not just as a student, but as a critical thinker and effective communicator. Over the course of this Maymester, I've delved deeper into fascinating topics, tackled challenging projects, and discovered new perspectives.</p>
            <p>In this reflection I would like to go over what I thought were the most important things I can take away from the course, organized into two groups: rhetorical strategies and writing process.</p>
