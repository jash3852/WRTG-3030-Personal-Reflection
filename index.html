    <!-- Introduction (put in box) -->
    <div class="container text-center border border-light border-5 mt-3 py-3 bg-white">
        <p>Hello! My name is Jasper Shen, an undergraduate student at CU Boulder. This website is a reflection of my journey throughout my time in WRTG 3030, where I have grown not just as a student, but as a critical thinker and effective communicator. Over the course of this Maymester, I've delved deeper into fascinating topics, tackled challenging projects, and discovered new perspectives.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, I took the AP English Language exam with a large worry on the rhetorical analysis essay. I struggled through the year-long class, managing to get through the course content with a shaky understanding of the content. Leaving with a semi-satisfactory 3 on the exam, I believe I could have done better, but I was glad to have been done struggling in the course. Now entering university, I find myself in a 3-week course on the same topic that I struggled with two years ago, gaining another attempt to redeem myself and properly understand the content.</p>
        <p>In this reflection I would like to go over what I thought were the most important things I can take away from the course, organized into two groups: rhetorical strategies and writing process.</p>

                        While knowing of the existence of the three rhetorical appeals: ethos, logos, and pathos, I never truly realized how powerful these appeals actually are before this course. Diving deeper into the theory of rhetorical appeals, I have come to understand their effects they have and the reasons for using them.    
                    </div>

                        My rhetorical analysis offered my insight into the rhetorical strategies used by the website dhmo.org. Nearly four whole pages of picking out specific rhetorical strategies, helping me understand the establishment of the rhetorical appeals. This provided me additional insights for the various ways that the rhetorical appeals could be established to produce a compelling and empowering argument.                    </div>
                </div>
 
                <div class="row border border-light border-5 my-3 py-3 bg-white">
                    <div class="col">
                        <b>Ethos: Credibility Appeal</b>
                        <br><br>
                        I discovered that many small things could contribute to establishing ethos, the appeal to credibility. Elements such as the tone of the writing, the logical connections, and a demonstration of expertise play a significant role in determining whether the audience will even receive the argument positively.
                        <br><br>
                        In both my rhetorical analysis and letter project, I highlighted how my recipient, the Dihydrogen Monoxide Research Division, utilized a scientific tone and technical language which made them seem knowledgeable on the topic and therefore were credible. Even if the information provided was misleading, this realization helped me understand why their website was so effective at making me believe that Dihydrogen Monoxide was dangerous. This emphasized the importance of presenting myself as credible to gain the trust of the audience, and eventually their understanding.

                    <div class="col">
                        <b>Logos: Logical Appeal</b>
                        <br><br>
                        I have also learned that logos, the logical appeal, has some overlap in establishing ethos, but remains its own entity. Providing evidence and showing logical reasoning not only establishes credibility, but also effectively supports my argument.
                        <br><br>
                        In my letter project, I emphasized the importance of skepticism, understanding that my audience would be reasonably skeptical of my arguments. This relayed the necessity of developing strong grounds for my argument.
                        <br><br>
                        In my creative nonfiction essay, I added a suitable number of hyperlinks to reliable sources and facts to establish that ground. I understood that my topic on GMOs was highly moderated by the government and current research, so I utilized the research to my own benefit to show that I have thought about my intended audience and convince them in ways that are suitable to them. 
                        <br><br>
                        By introducing reliable sources in my writing, I can create those grounds and establish some credibility at the same time.

                    <div class="col">
                        <b>Pathos: Emotional Appeal</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Sometimes, it came to me that a logical appeal isn't necessary in order to deliver an argument. Certain contexts demand the establishment of pathos, the emotional appeal, to connect to the audience on a deeper level and bring in their understanding.
                        <br><br>
                        Many advertisements, especially awareness advertisements, rely heavily on emotional appeals to convey their message. This is an interesting approach that still remains effective, even in the absence of logos.
                        <br><br>
                        I tried establishing pathos a great deal in my narrative in my creative nonfiction essay. I realized that a well-crafted narrative could hook the reader's interest and emotions without muddling it with any cold, hard evidence. I believe it was successful and helped me understand the absolute power of pathos.
                        <br><br>
                        Through the grueling hours in the experience of developing an emotional narrative, I find pathos as a means to connect to my audience on a deeper, more emotional level. I understood that appealing to the emotions of the audience can make my arguments more compelling and relatable, as an additional way of guiding them to understanding my perspectives.

                        <b>The Toolbox of Rhetorical Strategies</b>
                        <br><br>
                        This course made me realize the crucial role that rhetorical appeals play in connecting with my target audience. I believe that properly establishing the rhetorical appeals creates a foundation for the audience's understanding.
                        <br><br>
                        With this knowledge, I can enhance the way I communicate with my intended audience. The knowledge about rhetorical appeals I gained from this course provides me with a toolbox full of these rhetorical strategies in order to appeal to the audience. 
                        <br><br>
                        However, these rhetorical strategies are more than just tools for persuasion. They are fundamental principles that guide me to effective communication and connections with others. They have shaped my writing process, influencing how I view and engage with my audience.

                    <h4 class="text-center">Mind Maps</h4>
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="col">
                        One of the most unique and useful things I will take out of this course is the concept of mind maps. 
                        <br><br>
                        I like to think of mind maps as one large puzzle, where each idea is a puzzle piece. The way that subsections work in mind maps is like how I organize puzzle pieces into corner pieces, edge pieces, and regular pieces.
                        <br><br>
                        The initial scattering of the ideas in the mind map helps me realize that there is no real order that I need to adhere to when beginning to write. Regardless of where I start, as long as I connect everything properly, then the whole puzzle will be solved.
                        <br><br>
                        I find that this concept applies even further than just writing; it can apply to any creative process. Mind maps are a way of helping me organize my thoughts and streamline my development. They provide me with a visual representation of the connections between different ideas, making it easier to see how they all fit together. 
                        <br><br>
                        Whether I am writing an essay, planning a project, or brainstorming for a creative task, I know I can rely on mind maps to help me organize my thoughts and bring my ideas to fruition.

                        <h4 class="text-center">Paragraphing Styles</h4>
                        <br>
                        The most interesting thing I discovered about walls of text is that no one likes to read them. This realization got me thinking about how with connect to the audience, describe my perspective, and to support my perspective without overwhelming them with a large number of words towards their direction.
                        <br><br>
                        I never realized how much potential a single paragraph break had until I engaged with the activities of breaking up an entire essay with paragraph breaks. I see their power in placing emphasis on certain thoughts as well as giving the reader more motivation to read each paragraph, even if it has the same number of characters as a wall of text.
                        <br><br>
                        With what I have learned from different paragraphing styles, I can strategically structure my writing to enhance readability and engagement. Sometimes I even find myself breaking up text messages to my friends to help them understand my thoughts. By breaking up blocks of text, I know that I can guide the reader's attention through the key points to make my arguments more digestible and compelling. 
                        <br><br>
                        Understanding the power of a paragraph break has equipped me with a valuable tool to effectively communicate complex ideas in a reader-friendly manner. This is a skill I will continue to refine and apply as I broaden my network and find myself communicating with all kinds of individuals.

                    <div class="container px-3 text-center">
                        My creative nonfiction essay was my most evident piece of a very generous paragraphing style and is probably my proudest work out of this class. Four whole pages to demonstrate my development of the idea of GMO foods from the ground up, establishing rhetorical appeals and making it visually appealing to the audience through the paragraph breaks. With writing it similar to a journal article, I am beginning to view article's paragraph breaks as an implicit suggestion of the main idea.

                        <h4 class="text-center">Free Writing</h4>
                        <br>
                        At an early age, I learned that nothing is perfect. From this course, I learned that nothing needs to be perfect. With any creative process, the idea that the end result needs to be the best and flawless will always remain an idea if there is nothing to build it on.
                        <br><br>
                        Free writing has taught me to simply roll with whatever ideas I currently have and start constructing something. While I understand that the end product of the current process will be nowhere near as good as the idea of the final product, the knowledge of free writing helps me find a starting point to get the foundation of the final product out, so I have something I can build it on.
                        <br><br>
                        This reminds me how, even in the industry, companies do not care what the end product of the first creative process ends up being as long as it works. They usually refer to this as the “minimum viable product.” It assures me that no one expects the first end product to be the final product, and that people value the development process to consistently improve upon the first process.
                        <br><br>
                        This leads to me understand that the journey of creation is a continuous process of improvement. Embracing this mindset allows for growth, innovation, and the freedom to explore different ideas without fearing the necessity for perfection. It is the process that matters, not just the product. This is a lesson that I can carry forward in all my creative endeavors to help me get started.

                Through this reflection, my goal was to realize and connect everything I learned to my future communications. By being able to externally express what I have learned, I solidify my understanding of how I can use my knowledge to effectively communicate. Ironically enough, I chose a very generous paragraphing style simply because I picked up the habit of paragraphing more often as a reflection of how powerful I believe each paragraph break is.
                <br><br>
                I developed a webpage to house my reflection as a feeling of comfort as a Computer Science student and to further my understanding of how vastly different the users view the webpage as I do. Webpages are a combination of visual and verbal communication, allowing me to connect what I have learned in this writing course in relation to what I find myself working closest to in terms of communication. I had a lot of enjoyment customizing this webpage to combine my experience in user interfaces and my learning in this course.

                <br>
                Concluding the 3-week term, I find myself at a significantly different spot than I was just two years ago. 
                <br><br>
                I came into this course anticipating that it would be as challenging AP English Language class. This reminded me of my countless struggles, so I naturally felt defeated. However, I took it upon myself to fully engage with all the course material and approach this experience with an open mind.
                <br><br>
                I invested substantial effort in the assignments, developing my ideas thoroughly and continuously utilizing the opportunities to learn the content at a deeper level. During discussions, I not only focused on the words of others but also on how they constructed their responses. I thought that I could also utilize the discussions to understand the actions and thought processes of people with vastly different perspectives than mine. 
                <br><br>
                Through this, I gained a deeper understanding of the rhetorical appeals and was able to apply this knowledge to multiple projects. It reminded me of how reading a poem for the second time makes the message clearer. I found myself at this realization multiple times throughout the term and became more engaged in the material as a result.
                <br><br>
                Finishing the term, I don't feel defeated anymore. In fact, I feel like I could conquer the world. Despite all the challenges and mental difficulties I faced while completing the course content, I believe my effort in this class will pay off as a multitude of life skills for communication.
                <br><br>
                Considering my effort and personal growth throughout the course, I believe an A is a fair reflection of my performance for this term. I have not only met the course objectives, but I have also gained valuable insights and practical skills that will help me in future endeavors.
